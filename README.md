- Maplestory Social Media Site

- Things that still need to be added:
  fixing feed

- Things im doing/have done today 9/20

  - Move create post to its seperate create post page
  - create usernames
  - add ability to move from sign in -> signup from both pages
  - fix rootlayout showing on signin/signup page
  - show the username of the person who posted it
  - be able to view your own posts

  - For another day:
    - implement search functionality
    - add comment section
    - Usernames must be unique

  Random Ideas popping into my head that I need to write down somewhere:

- Sign in page will have the ability to sign in via maplestory account
  Next to it will say dont have a maple account no problem sign in via google or create your own maple media account
- ability to sort by popularity(# of likes) or by date posted
- ability to like/dislike a post
